# mazeGame

A maze game that autogenerates a **solvable** puzzle randomly. With a *user* object that the player can control using the standard WASD movement pattern.
      -W = Up
      -A = Left
      -S = Down
      -D = Right
      
The maze was generated with matterJS library, https://brm.io/matter-js/ , a 2d phsyics engine and canvas API.
